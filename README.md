Final Project 
How I Approach Developing Programs

I approach development by writing clean, readable code and testing changes as I go. I prioritize making the program work correctly first, then improving structure and visuals once the core logic is stable.

New Development Strategies Used
While working on this project, I used modular functions and reusable components to manage transformations, textures, and lighting. I also relied heavily on visual feedback to debug issues related to object placement and lighting behavior.

Role of Iteration
Iteration was essential to completing this project. Many elements—such as lighting placement, texture scaling, and camera movement—required repeated adjustment and testing to achieve the desired result. Each milestone built on the previous one, allowing steady improvement without overwhelming changes.

How My Development Approach Evolved

At the start of the course, I focused mainly on getting code to compile and display objects. By the end of the project, I was more intentional about structure, readability, and visual outcome. I became more comfortable troubleshooting graphical issues and refining details to improve the final presentation.

How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals

Computer science provides problem-solving skills that extend beyond any single language or tool. This project strengthened my ability to think logically, debug complex systems, and translate abstract ideas into working software—all skills that support my long-term career goals in technology.
Educational Impact of Computational Graphics
Working with computational graphics helped me better understand how math, physics, and programming intersect. These skills support future coursework in graphics, game development, simulation, and visualization.
Professional Impact of Computational Graphics
From a professional standpoint, this project demonstrates my ability to build interactive visual systems, follow structured development processes, and communicate technical decisions clearly. These skills are valuable in fields such as software development, visualization, simulation, and interactive application design.

Conclusion

This project represents the culmination of multiple milestones and reflects my growth in both software design and development. By creating a complete 3D scene from the ground up, I gained hands-on experience with computational graphics and a deeper understanding of how interactive visual environments are built.
